##  MentAllay
During the COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia, adults in poor general health (which may reflect both physical and mental health) continue to report higher rates of depression than adults in good general health. When we talk about health, we mainly focus on Mental health. Nelson and Kaminsky (2020) report that after months of social distancing, job losses, and business and school closures amid COVID-19, mental health experts are warning of another massive crisis. Psychologists and psychiatrists see multiple waves of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  The suicidal ideation that reached 468 in just the first 5 months of 2021, which is nearly equal to the annual number of suicides in 2020 and 2019. Therefore, our project MentAllay a Mobile application will provide a community where patients can share their feelings and thoughts and be for each other. The proposed project aims to alleviate the problem faced by individuals by using some features. For instance, it provides a various way to reduce their stress and relax, get Islamic guidance about their current mood by listening to Allah words, that will be well picked by using many thrusted sources. Users can choose between entering their feelings or they can choose from the categories provided. The app is equipped with an AI search where the system can predict users’ feelings based on the input and provide them with the appropriate audio that can help it alleviate their feelings. By including, such a feature (Islamic healing) shows our uniqueness in the market among other application that aim for the same objective in a different way.  Not only This project will help with mental health but also strengthen the bound of the user with Allah, to do so we need to carry out discovery and research through interviews, surveys, and the reading of system-related literature.

#  REGISTRATION 
We use Firebase Authentication, as well as Firebase Database and Firebase Storage, for registration. For Firebase Authentication, we store the username, password, and email address in Firebase storage, the ID picture in Firebase database, the user information and image link in Firebase database, then we display the information in the admin page and give it the admin privilege to delete the user in our backend.
#  RELAXATION TECHNIQUES
To train the data for the relaxation strategy, we use Google Natural Language API and Multi-label Classification. We upload the user input to the API on the backend and fitch the prediction from the API based on the user input. Then we play the audio that corresponds to the user's mood. In addition, we provide another option to choose from an existing category. And for the audios, we used a few books such as (موسوعة التفسير الموضوعي للقرآن الكريم, كتاب مفاتيح الفرج, كتاب عالج نفسك بالقرآن)    We have a total of 40 Ayah for Sadness, 33 Ayah for Fear, 25 Ayah for Anger, and 25 Ayah for Worries. And we only utilized a few effects to blend the ayah, so there will be no stopping effect.

#  Forum and connect 
We use Firebase Database for both features. The user can create new posts for the forum, and by doing so, we build a new collection inside the firebase database, and within this collection, we create a new collection for the comments, and we update the amount of likes within the collection.
